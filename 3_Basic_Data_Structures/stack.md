# What is a stack?

A stack is a data structure that follows Last-In First-Out (LIFO), like a stack of cafeteria trays.

Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items.

The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.

Another great example of a stack is your browser's Back button.  As you move from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are going on the stack).  The current page is on the top of the stack and the first page you looked is the base.  If you click on the back button you move in reverse order through the pages.
